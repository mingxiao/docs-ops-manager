Select a **Blobstore Location** to either configure the blobstore as an internal server or an external endpoint. Because the internal server is unscalable and less secure, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you configure an external blobstore.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you deploy the BOSH Director, only <%= vars.ops_manager %> users in Advanced Mode can change the blobstore location. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/customizing/lock-on-deploy.html"><%= vars.ops_manager %> Fields That Lock On Deploy</a>.</p>
  * **Internal:** Select this option to use an internal blobstore. <%= vars.ops_manager %> creates a new VM for blob storage. No additional configuration is required.
  * **S3 Compatible Blobstore:** Select this option to use an external S3-compatible endpoint.

    When you have created an S3 bucket, configure the following fields:
    <% else %>
    To create an S3 bucket, follow the procedures in [Sign up for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) and [Creating a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the AWS documentation. When you have created an S3 bucket, configure the following fields:
    <% end %>
      1. **S3 Endpoint:**
          1. **If you are using a public S3 endpoint:**
              1. Locate the endpoint for your region. To find the endpoint, see the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table in [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the AWS documentation.
              1. Construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the `us-west-2` region, the URL you create would be <code>https<span>:</span>//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</code>. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field.
          1. **If you are using a non-public S3-compatible endpoint:**
              1. Enter the URL for the non-public endpoint.
              1. SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM by running:<br>`ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN`
                  <br>
                  Where `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
              1. Copy the custom public CA certificate you used to sign the S3 endpoint into the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory on the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.
              1. On the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, import the custom CA certificate into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM truststore by running:<br>`sudo update-ca-certificates -f -v`
              1. Add this custom CA certificate into the **Trusted Certificates** field in the **Security** page. For instructions, see [Security Page](#security).
      1. **Bucket Name:** Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
      1. **URL Style:** Select either path-style or domain-style to specify the URL style for the S3-compatible blobstore. By default, the blobstore uses domain-style URLs.
          <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> AWS ends support for path-style URLs for all S3 buckets created after September 30, 2020. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#domain-style">Support for Virtual-Hosted-Style URLs for AWS S3 Blobstores</a>.</p>
      <% if current_page.data.iaas == "AWS" %>
      1. **Credentials Source:**
      Input your credentials from the following sources.
          - **Static Credentials:** In **Access Key** and **Secret Key**, enter the keys you generated when creating your S3 bucket.
          - **IAM Profile:** Use the IAM profile associated with the BOSH Director.
      <% else %>
      1. **Access Key** and **Secret Key:** Enter the keys you generated when creating your S3 bucket.
      <% end %>
      1. **Enable signed URLs:** Select this checkbox to configure BOSH VMs to generate short-lived, pre-signed URLs for communication between the BOSH Agent and blobstore. If you enable this feature, BOSH Agents do not use credentials to communicate with the blobstore, and VM disks do not store blobstore credentials.
          <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is experimental and only available for BOSH VMs that use Xenial stemcell line 621 or later.</p>
      1. Select **V2 Signature** or **V4 Signature**. If you select **V4 Signature**, enter your **Region**.
          <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> AWS recommends using Signature Version 4. For more information about AWS S3 Signatures, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests</a> in the AWS documentation.</p>
      1. **S3 Backup Strategy:** To configure whether and how to back up the BOSH Director's S3 blobstore, select one of the following options:
          * **No backups**
          * **Use a versioned bucket:** This option uses blobstore bucket versioning to save backups. It requires an S3 blobstore that supports versioning.
          * **Copy into an additional bucket:** This option saves blobstore backups to a separate bucket, which is useful with blobstores that do not support versioning. This option requires you to configure the **Backup Bucket Region** and **Backup Bucket Name** fields.
  * **GCS Blobstore:** Select this option to use an external Google Cloud Storage (GCS) endpoint.

      1. **GCS Backup Strategy:** To configure whether and how to back up the BOSH Director's GCS blobstore, select one of the following options:
          * **No backups**
          * **Copy into an additional bucket:** This option saves blobstore backups to a bucket separate from the blobstore itself, and requires you to configure the **Backup Bucket Region** and **Backup Bucket Name** fields.
